This is a file to explain my Lab 2 work


To run my code all you need to do is use the command

make lab2

command in the root of the repository
This will cause the relevant lines of code needed to make the tables and create the output run






The extracts for this assignment are in the
Lab2SampleOutputs folder

It has extract1.csv which is a list of all of the cars ordered by rank with columns for total score and rank

it has extract2.csv which is the list of all cars ordered first by make and then by rank
It was not possible to restrict this to only the top 3 cars of each rank
To only show the top 3 cars of each Make I would need access to the PARTITION BY command
which is not available in our version of Linux

It has a JudgeData.csv
This file holds the relevant data from the judges table
We were not specifically told what to do with this output so it is displayed to the screen when the command is 
run and it is sent to this file 



Data used to create the database
The data is taken from the gist provided
There were 2 problems with the data provided which meant that the data needed to be cleaned before it could be used

The first probem was that the dates were given in the format 1/2/1990
The problem with this is that SQL only understands dates with dashes and not slashes like
1-2-1990

The Second problem is that for SQL to understand dates they must have leading zeroes
So instead of dates being
1-2-1990
They need to be in the form of
01-02-1990

I clean up both of this problems by using 2 sed command right after eachother and storing the intermediate
data in a file and passing that as the input to the next sed command

Then I store the cleaned data in
cleanedLab2Data.csv 
This is where my program will be drawing the data from




the
lab2SQLscripts.sql
holds the scripts used to create the outputs and database
I only needed one script this time
There are some parts of the code that can be removed and optimized



The 
MakeFile
now holds the instructions that the command
make lab2
runs

The script file 
Lab2ScriptFileLog
shows the output to the screen that is produced when running the code
This was generated by using the Linux script command




There were certain aspects of this assignment that were incredibly hard to do or maybe even impossible
The main reason for this is that we are working on a Linux system that is outdated by 10 years
That means there are many quality of life features we are missing 
Also it means that it is hard to find relevant help as the questions being asked on the internet and the respinses given are for the
more modern versions.

For example I found it incredibly difficult to update data in a table
It was always preferable to insert data into a new table

I also could not find a workaround to give onlt the top 3 cars of each make














Grading rubric (for full points, please include the following in your project repository): 
"	Provide a data dictionary for your final set of tables.This is a description of your table (or database) schema. Please name this file data_dictonary.md and use markdown formatting to format it.

This is available in the data_dictionary.md file



"	Include SQL script(s) that would be able to regenerate the entire database.

This is avaliable in
lab2SQLscripts.sql

"	Include the extract1.csv and extract2.csv files noted above
These are available in the Lab2SampleOutputs folder


"	Capture text-based file(s) that contains a log of your terminal session (use the script command).
This is available in
Lab2ScriptFileLog


"	Include anything else you think would help your reader understand your work and where to find files you've prepared.

There is more info on the project in the Lab2README.md file
Also there is a JudgesData.csv in the Lab2SampleOutputs folder 
This shows the judge data that was asked for



1.	Update the submodule linked data file
Completed

2.	Import the sample data into these tables in an SQLite3 database. You may have to create separate tables before you can import data: 
o	Cars table with primary key Car_ID and contains car information such as Year, Make, Model as well as owner information
Completed
o	Judges table that contains Judge_ID, Judge Name
Completed
o	Car_Score table that contains the scores for each car with Car_ID as the primary key
Completed
2.	Using the database created with the tables noted above: 
o	Write a single SQLite3 query that shows the results for all cars (that query the correct tables).  Compute the total score for each row. The output should show (ranking, car_id, year, car make, car model). Present the list in descending order using the total column and make sure you add a new ranking column. Export the results a file named extract1.csv. (Note: you may have to write multiple queries to figure out the single query)
Completed
o	Write an SQLite3 query that shows for each Car Make grouping: a list of the top 3 cars of that Make. The output should contain at minimum the following fields:  ranking, car make, car_id, total score. Export the results to a file named extract2.csv
Completed to best of ability
3.	Update the Judges table with the following information. You will need to create new fields: 
o	Counts the number of cars each judge has judged for the day
Completed
o	A field that shows the 'start' or the first timestamp of judging for the day
Completed
o	A field that shows the 'end' or the final timestamp of judging for the day
Completed
o	The duration between start and end times
Completed
o	An 'average' speed score that is a calculated as duration divided by number of cars judged.
Completed
o	Try to complete this in a single query if you can.
Completed I think
4.	Your above work should be saved in *.sql file(s) and saved to your Git project repository.
Completed





Also I am having some difficulty with the linux servers
There are some files that I delete but they are still puched when I push to github

Also I am not sure how to move files into folders
